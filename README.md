# Clean Code
The following will be summaries of the chapters in Clean Code by Uncle Bob. The aim is to summarise each chapter, which will contain the key concepts of the chapter, along with examples that will illustrate them.

## Chapter 1: Clean Code
Let's take an example mentioned in the book, about a (nameless) company who has released a great and popular app in the 80s. They hit the ground running, the development was fast and they were making a great product; until some point. The development speed decreased, bugs were not fixed and eventually this company went out of buisness. Why? Because at the start of the project the developers didn't take the time to build a clean, maintenable system (according to one of the early stage developer of the project). Keyword being clean, as clean code makes the code base easy to change and understand. Clean code unsures that productivity will not end up plummeting.

In order to know why clean code helps with productivity, first we need to talk about what is clean code. So what is it?

According to some well known and deeply experienced programmers, clean code is elegant, efficient, does one thing well (focused), reads like a well-written prose, can be read and enhanced by a developer who is not the original author, looks like it was written by someone who cares, contains no duplication and pretty much what you expected. The common theme along most of the listed items are that the code is easy to read and is easy to change. Most of our time programming, is spent on reading code in order to add to it or enhance it. If the code is clean, it is easy to read and understand, so less time is spent on reading, which leaves more time to procude clean code. This is why productivity will not plummet in a clean code base (as long as it is kept clean).
